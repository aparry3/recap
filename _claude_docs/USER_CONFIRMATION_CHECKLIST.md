# Admin User Confirmation Email Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Step-by-step implementation guide for adding email confirmation when creating or promoting admin users in the Recap application.

## Phase 1: Email Service Enhancement ✓

### 1.1 Create Admin Invitation Email Template
- [x] Create `/src/lib/email/templates/admin-invitation.ts`:
  - [x] Create interface `AdminInvitationEmailData` with fields: `name`, `verificationUrl`
  - [x] Create `getAdminInvitationEmailTemplate()` function
  - [x] Design HTML email template with:
    - [x] Subject: "You've been added as an admin to Recap!"
    - [x] Recap branding (logo, colors from welcome template)
    - [x] Body text: "You have been added as an admin to Recap! Please follow the link below to login"
    - [x] CTA button text: "Access Admin Dashboard"
    - [x] Mobile-responsive table-based layout
    - [x] Footer with copyright
  - [x] Use similar styling to `welcome.ts` template

### 1.2 Email Service Updates
- [x] Update `/src/lib/email.ts`:
  - [x] Import `getAdminInvitationEmailTemplate` from new template file
  - [x] Create `sendAdminInvitationEmail()` method in SendGridClient class
  - [x] Use same pattern as `sendCreationEmail()` with HTML template
  - [x] Add TypeScript interface for admin invitation data

## Phase 2: Backend API Updates ✓

### 2.1 Verification Service Enhancement
- [x] Update `/src/lib/db/personService.ts`:
  - [x] Modify `insertVerification()` to accept optional `isAdminVerification` flag
  - [x] Ensure verification records work without galleryId for admin verifications

### 2.2 Admin Creation API Update
- [x] Modify `/src/app/api/admin/admins/route.ts` POST handler:
  - [x] Import `insertVerification` and `sendGridClient`
  - [x] After creating/updating admin user:
    - [x] Create verification record
    - [x] Send admin invitation email
    - [x] Handle email send failures gracefully
  - [x] Add try-catch for email sending (don't fail user creation if email fails)
  - [x] Log email send status

### 2.3 Create Admin Verification Endpoint
- [x] Create `/src/app/api/admin/verify/[verificationId]/route.ts`:
  - [x] GET handler to process verification
  - [x] Validate verification ID exists and not expired
  - [x] Check person has isAdmin flag
  - [x] Mark verification as used
  - [x] Return success with personId
  - [x] Handle invalid/expired verifications

## Phase 3: Frontend Verification Flow ✓

### 3.1 Create Admin Verification Page
- [x] Create `/src/app/admin/verify/[verificationId]/page.tsx`:
  - [x] Client component that processes verification
  - [x] Update verification status
  - [x] Set personId cookie using existing cookie helper
  - [x] Show success message briefly
  - [x] Auto-redirect to `/admin` after 2 seconds
  - [x] Handle error cases (invalid/expired link)

### 3.2 Create Verification UI Component
- [x] Create `/src/components/AdminVerification/index.tsx`:
  - [x] Success state with checkmark icon
  - [x] Loading state during verification
  - [x] Error state for invalid links
  - [x] Use existing Recap styling patterns
  - [x] Include "Redirecting to admin dashboard..." message

### 3.3 Style Verification Page
- [x] Create `/src/components/AdminVerification/AdminVerification.module.scss`:
  - [x] Center content on page
  - [x] Success/error message styling
  - [x] Animation for checkmark
  - [x] Consistent with existing verification pages

## Phase 4: Admin Modal Integration

### 4.1 Update CreateAdminModal
- [ ] Modify `/src/app/admin/CreateAdminModal.tsx`:
  - [ ] Add success message about email being sent
  - [ ] Update success toast to mention email sent
  - [ ] Handle case where user creation succeeds but email fails

### 4.2 Update Admin Page
- [ ] Modify `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`:
  - [ ] Show toast notification: "Admin created and invitation email sent"
  - [ ] Consider adding email status indicator in admin list

## Phase 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### 5.1 Email Failure Handling
- [ ] Create fallback for email send failures:
  - [ ] Log failures to error tracking
  - [ ] Still create admin user
  - [ ] Show warning toast if email fails
  - [ ] Provide option to resend (future enhancement)

### 5.2 Verification Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle expired verifications (24 hour expiry)
- [ ] Handle already-used verifications
- [ ] Handle verifications for non-admin users
- [ ] Handle missing verification records

### 5.3 Security Considerations
- [ ] Ensure verification links are single-use
- [ ] Add rate limiting for verification attempts
- [ ] Log all admin access for audit trail
- [ ] Validate personId has admin privileges before setting cookie

## Phase 6: Testing

### 6.1 Email Testing
- [ ] Test email template rendering in SendGrid
- [ ] Test email delivery to various providers
- [ ] Verify email appears correctly on mobile
- [ ] Test with long names and special characters

### 6.2 Verification Flow Testing
- [ ] Test creating new admin user
- [ ] Test promoting existing user to admin
- [ ] Test clicking verification link
- [ ] Test expired verification links
- [ ] Test invalid verification IDs
- [ ] Test already-used verification links

### 6.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Full flow: Create admin → Receive email → Click link → Access admin
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent admin creations
- [ ] Test email retry logic
- [ ] Verify audit logging works

### 6.4 Security Testing
- [ ] Attempt to access admin without verification
- [ ] Try to reuse verification links
- [ ] Test with manipulated verification IDs
- [ ] Verify non-admins can't use admin verifications

## Phase 7: Documentation & Monitoring

### 7.1 Update Documentation
- [ ] Document new environment variable in `.env.example`
- [ ] Update admin setup documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for email issues
- [ ] Document verification link format

### 7.2 Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Add logging for email send success/failure
- [ ] Track verification completion rate
- [ ] Monitor for expired verifications
- [ ] Set up alerts for high email failure rate

### 7.3 Code Cleanup
- [ ] Run linter (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Run type checker (`pnpm tsc`)
- [ ] Remove any console.log statements
- [ ] Add appropriate error messages

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Admin can create new admin users who receive invitation emails
- [ ] Admin can promote existing users who receive notification emails
- [ ] Recipients can click email link to access admin dashboard
- [ ] Verification links are secure and single-use
- [ ] Email failures don't prevent user creation
- [ ] All error cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Audit trail maintained for admin access
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback at each step

## Implementation Order

1. Email service and template (Phase 1)
2. Backend API updates (Phase 2)
3. Frontend verification flow (Phase 3)
4. Modal integration (Phase 4)
5. Error handling (Phase 5)
6. Testing (Phase 6)
7. Documentation (Phase 7)

## Time Estimates

- Phase 1: 1 hour (template creation)
- Phase 2: 2 hours (API updates)
- Phase 3: 2 hours (verification pages)
- Phase 4: 30 minutes (modal updates)
- Phase 5: 1.5 hours (error handling)
- Phase 6: 2 hours (testing)
- Phase 7: 1 hour (documentation)

**Total: ~9.5 hours**

## Dependencies

- SendGrid account access for template creation
- Environment variable updates
- Existing verification system
- Existing admin management features

## Risk Mitigation

- Email service outages: Log failures, don't block user creation
- Verification link security: Single-use, time-limited links
- User confusion: Clear email content and UI feedback
- Performance: Async email sending, don't block UI
